# Hashtables
Hashing is a technique that is used to uniquely identify a specific object from a group of similar objects. Some examples of how hashing is used in our lives include:

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Implement the Hash Tables

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
Big O  time O(1)

## API

`constructor` take the size and made array of this size

`hash` to hash the key and convert it to number

`add` add key value per to the array using linked list

`get` get the value of the key if exist

`contains` check if the key found in the array
